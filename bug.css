The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the units used in the calculation are inconsistent or if there are operator precedence issues. For example, `width: calc(100% - 50px)` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 50)` might not produce the desired outcome because it's missing the 'px' unit for 50. Similarly, complex calculations can lead to unexpected behavior if the order of operations isn't clearly defined using parentheses.  Another issue is using `calc()` with values that are not yet resolved, resulting in a calculation based on an invalid or undefined value.
